# Task2

The second subtask is to embed the string - "Embedathon" into a namespace called "IEEE_NITK" into the ESP32's NVM using the preferences.h library and the Espressif framework. This round's results will not be evaluated for the final standings, but will serve as an important step to the hackathon's problem statement. Refer to the documentation for this round here:
